You will need to create the following file locations:

/mnt/movies = This is your archive of media, your entire library.
/mnt/core_movies = This is the movies you NEVER want to change. I move the files to this location to protect them. The directory is read only until I want to add a few movies to the always available catagory. 
/mnt/rotation_movies = this folder is reserved for the symlinks OR you can movie the files with the python script if you want to modify it. The problem with moving the files is the potential for losing files in the transfer and thrashing the disc by moving the files.
